# AGENT Instructions

This repository uses **pnpm**, TypeScript, and Electron. When updating or extending the codebase:

1. Format code with `pnpm format` and run lint checks with `pnpm lint` before committing.
2. Execute the unit tests via `pnpm test`. All tests should pass.
3. If you add or modify dependencies, use `pnpm install` to update `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
4. Keep the roadmap in `ROADMAP.md` up to date when significant milestones are completed.
5. Provide clear commit messages and update documentation when needed.
