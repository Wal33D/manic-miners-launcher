## Contributing:

We welcome contributions! Whether it's submitting bug reports, feature suggestions, or contributing to the code, check out our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on getting involved.

## Code of Conduct:

This project adheres to a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Development

If you want to build the launcher from source you'll need **Node.js 20.19.2 or newer**.

1. Run `nvm use` to activate the Node.js version specified in `.nvmrc`.
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
3. Start the app in development mode using `pnpm start`.
4. To create distributable packages run `pnpm run make`.

> **Note**
> The `src/fileUtils` folder now only contains the utilities currently used by
> the launcher (`createShortcut`, `findLatestVersionPath` and the helpers in
> `fileOps`). Older helpers were removed.

### macOS TypeScript checks

On macOS the TypeScript checker used during development can crash with `EPIPE`
errors. The build scripts automatically disable this check on darwin systems.
If you want to run the checker anyway, set the `FORCE_TS_CHECK` environment
variable before starting the app:

```bash
export FORCE_TS_CHECK=1
pnpm start
```

Unset `FORCE_TS_CHECK` to restore the default behaviour and avoid potential
`EPIPE` crashes.

### Environment Variables

`SERVER_BASE_URL` sets the base URL used for update checks and other API calls.
If not provided, the launcher defaults to `https://manic-launcher.vercel.app`.
Set this variable before running the app if you need to target a different
server.

Example:

```bash
SERVER_BASE_URL=https://my-server.example.com pnpm start
```

This variable can also be set in your operating system's environment or in a `.env` file.

`COMPAT_LAUNCHER` allows you to specify the command used to run the Windows game on non-Windows platforms. The default is `wine`, but you can set it to `proton run` or another wrapper.

## Assets

## Security Notes

`pnpm audit` currently reports no high-severity issues.
The latest available `itchio-downloader` release (0.8.1) is already in use, so
the vulnerable dependencies (`express`, `puppeteer`, and `tar-fs`) referenced in
earlier audits have been resolved. Only moderate vulnerabilities remain in
`webpack-dev-server`. Keep an eye on future releases for additional fixes.

Happy mining!
